## query-to-github
* ## Project Title: 
   - This project is named as 'query-to github'.
* ## Project Description:
   - The project is aiming to write sql queries in pgAdmin to create the database and tables, then all the queries in the project will be hosted the github.
   - As for the database bank, it includes designing the database, tables, columns and collecting all the information for the customer of bank. Then we can use these information to analyze the consumption of customer and forecast what type of financial products are more likely to be sold better.
   - But currently, only the first step, database designing, tables creating, and basic information analyzing are done in this project. The deep analysis and forecasting maybe need effort on the more tables creating later.
* ## Tables in this database:
   - In this project, a database named bank is designed and created. It is about collecting and analyzing the information of login, account, transaction, and balance for customers of the bank.
   - There are 10 tables in this database including customer, customeraccount, accounttype, userlogins, and so on. There are relationship between the tables by connecting with primary key and foreign key.
* ## How to use this project:
   - There are two sql files in this project right now.
   - One is Bank_Customer_Info.sql that is to create the database and tables and then insert values for each table. This work will let the database be usable.
   - The another one is Bank_Customer_View.sql that is containing some queries to create views and queries for us to use the database.
